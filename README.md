Advent of Code Solutions
Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This project contains my solutions for the yearly Advent of Code challenges. These programming puzzles are a great way to enhance problem-solving skills, learn new techniques, and have fun coding during the festive season.

🛠️ Project Structure :
The repository is organized as follows:

graphql
Copy code
/year/
  ├── input.txt   
  ├── solution.py     # Solution code for Day 1
  ├── input.txt
  ├── solution.py
  └── ...
Each folder represents a specific day of the challenge, containing:

input.txt: The input data for the puzzle of that day.
solution: The implementation of the solution in Python (or your preferred language).
📋 Requirements
To run the solutions, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+ (or other relevant interpreters for your chosen language)
Any necessary libraries, which can be installed via:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Running Solutions
To execute the solution for a specific day:

Navigate to the folder of the desired day:
bash
Copy code
cd year/day01
Run the solution file:
bash
Copy code
python solution.py
🌟 Advent of Code Overview
Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that run for 25 days in December. Each day brings a new problem, increasing in difficulty. The goal is to solve these puzzles as efficiently as possible.
